# SecurePad
A simple notepad like program which compresses and encrypts / decrypts text.

This program was mostly generated by ChatGPT, with a little assistance.

It is designed to create, view and edit a text file which is stored inside an encrypted ZIP.

The motivation is to add a layer of security around text based notes which are stored on a users computer or in cloud storage.

If an unauthorised user gains access to your computer, or cloud storage, they will not be able to read the contents of your text files.

Please note that a strong password should be used.
